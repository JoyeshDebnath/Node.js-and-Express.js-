 if u install package.json by npm init -y  a package.json with all default val will be created .

It is already  mentioned in our packages.json so he just needs to run the command npm install and automatically all the packages and dependencies which we have used in our original projects will be automatically installed and added in his project  too.This is what the importance of gitignore and package.json together ......ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘©ðŸ‘©ðŸ‘©
